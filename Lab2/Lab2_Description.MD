# LAB 2: METHODS

## 1. OBJECTIVE
The objectives of Lab2 are to practise on Java methods.

## 2. INTRODUCTION
A method is an independent collection of source code designed to perform a specific task. By dividing
a problem into sub_problems and solve the sub_problems by methods, we obtain a program which is
better structured, easier to test, debug and modify. We will practise on writing methods in Java in this
lab.
